# Invoke-GroupMessageTrace

## SYNOPSIS
Initiates a message trace for specified group types in batches.

## DESCRIPTION
The `Invoke-GroupMessageTrace` function allows administrators to perform message traces for various group types within Microsoft Exchange Online. This function enables tracking of messages sent and received by distribution lists, dynamic distribution lists, M365 groups, or all group types collectively.

The tracing can be configured to process groups in specified batch sizes, making it efficient for larger environments. The function retrieves groups based on the specified `GroupType` and initiates message trace reports for the last defined number of days. This provides deeper insight into message flow and any potential issues. The option to include outbound message traces offers further visibility into emails sent from groups where the group acts as the sender.

## PARAMETERS

### IncludeOutbound

  - `False` (excludes outbound message traces)  

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Invoke-GroupMessageTrace -BatchSize 50 -DaysBack 30 -GroupType "M365Group" -IncludeOutbound
```
*Initiates a message trace for M365 Groups over the last 30 days, processing 50 groups at a time, and includes outbound message traces.*

### Example 2
```powershell
Invoke-GroupMessageTrace -BatchSize 100 -DaysBack 60 -GroupType "AllGroups"
```
*Initiates a message trace for all group types over the last 60 days, processing 100 groups at a time, without including outbound messages.*

### Example 3
```powershell
Invoke-GroupMessageTrace -BatchSize 20 -DaysBack 14 -GroupType "DistributionList" -IncludeOutbound
```
*Initiates a message trace for Distribution Lists over the last 14 days, processing 20 groups at a time, and includes outbound message traces.*

## INPUTS
None. This function does not accept pipeline input.
